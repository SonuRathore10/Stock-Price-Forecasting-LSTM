# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Forecasting API using LSTM (FastAPI)
A deep learning project for predicting stock closing prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in TensorFlow/Keras, featuring a FastAPI backend for real-time predictions based on Yahoo Finance data.

## Overview
This project implements a time series forecasting pipeline to predict stock closing prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. It includes:

- An LSTM-based deep learning model for price prediction.
- Data processing and exploratory analysis.
- A FastAPI backend for serving predictions via HTTP endpoints.
- Support for both historical (actual) and future (predicted) closing prices

### Features
- Automated Data Retrieval: Downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans, normalizes, and sequences data for time series modeling.
- Deep Learning Model: Stacked LSTM with dropout layers for regularization.
- Performance Evaluation: Calculates RMSE and visualizes predictions.
- API Service: FastAPI endpoint for real-time price prediction.
- Handles Both Past and Future Dates: Returns actual prices for past dates, predictions for future dates

### Project Structure
- lstm_model_keras.py    # Model training and analysis notebook/script
- main.py                # FastAPI backend with prediction endpoint
- predict.py             # Prediction logic and data utilities
- lstm_model.keras       # Saved Keras model file
- README.md              # Project documentation

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-lstm-predictor.git
cd stock-lstm-predictor 
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Train the LSTM Model**

- Run lstm_model_keras.py to:
- Download stock data (default: Tesla, "TSLA")
- Analyze and visualize trends, returns, and volatility
- Train and evaluate the LSTM model
- Save the trained model as lstm_model.keras

4. **Start the API**

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

5. **Get a prediction**

- Use an API tool or browser to POST to /predict with parameters:
  - stock_code: e.g. TSLA
  - date: e.g. 2025-07-01
    
Example using curl:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict?stock_code=TSLA&date=2025-07-01"
```

### How to Use the API

Predict Stock Price
Endpoint: POST /predict

Parameters (as query):
  - stock_code: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., TSLA, AAPL)
  - date: Date for prediction in YYYY-MM-DD format

Response:

- For past/today: Returns actual closing price from Yahoo Finance.
- For future: Returns predicted price from the LSTM model.

Sample JSON Output:
```
{
  "stock": "TSLA",
  "predicted_price": 742.15,
  "date": "2025-07-01"
}
```
